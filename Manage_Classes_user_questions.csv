"I assigned practice activities with the staggered release for the first week as I didn't want to overwhelm students or facilitiate rushing. However, I am now ready to give them more flexibility to move ahead without completing every activity. Can I simply ""edit"" the release at this point without impacting the data/progress?"
How can I get the class codes to have students join?
How do I add a coteacher to my classes?
I am a coteacher in an ELA class. The gen Ed teacher uses Quill and I want to be able to view the data from our class. I can not see our classroom. How do I get access to view the students reports from the gen Ed teacher?
is there a way to change owner account to another teacher?
