"Hi, In my 3rd hour class, I have a student named Mia and her Activity Summary looks different than all my other students - she has no activities assigned. Even on her end - no activities assigned. Yet she answered questions incorrectly on the pre-diagnostic. I think something is glitching on her account. Please check into it?"
How can I unlock locked activities for students?
"Hello, I have a student who finished his diagnostic after his classmates. They all have the lessons assigned that were suggested after taking their diagnostics, but he doesn't. How can I assign them to him now?"
"Hi! After taking the diagnostic, are students automatically assigned activities that will help them based on that information or do I have to assign each activity to my students?"
"I have students who completed the starter diagnostic (and it displays that login as their 'last active'), but it says they have 0 activities completed. How do I fix this and access their diagnostic data?"
"Also, how can I tell who has finished the basic diagnostic?"
My students did the diagnostic. Now what? Will quill assign them activities based on the diagnostic?
How can I get those activities to unlock?
and I accidentally deleted the students' scores from the intermediate diagnostic for english 12 period 2 (probably english 12 period 8 as well. Will you please make that information available again?
I would like for to use the feature that assigns activities based on student diagnostic scores. How do I do this?
Why can't I get it to assign and recommend activities automatically after the diagnostic is completed?
Thank you. Can I do that by student and not the whole group?
"I would like to be able to assign the recommended tasks after a diagnostic test into weekly tasks, so that I can see at a glance that students are meeting my criteria. I would prefer a weekly overview of their results as well. Is there any way this can be done?"
"I had a student complete the pre-test diagnostic, but now I want him to view his path. I didn't see his path anywhere. How does he access it?"
"If I have students who complete the starter diagnostic test, complete the activities, complete the post test, and complete the secondary activities, but it is clear that they still need more practice in the areas, what do you suggest? Should I give them the starter diagnostic test again and go through the same activities?"
My students have completed baseline diagnostic activities and I want to assign practice on the skills that were identified. How can I do that?
